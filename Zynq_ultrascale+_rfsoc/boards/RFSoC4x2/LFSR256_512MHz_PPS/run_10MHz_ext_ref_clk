Running RFSoC4x2 noise source with external 10MHz ref clock 


1. Make clock connections with a board -> give 10 MHz output from TM5101 to CLK_IN SMA port of the board; connect 5V DC power supply; connect GPS antenna to GNSS SMA port of the clock 

2. Give power (12V power adapter) to the board  and connect the board to the PC with USB composite cable  

3. Make connection between DAC_A SMA port of the board and Spectrum analyzer with coax and connect spectrum analyzer to the lab machine (intended to use with spectrum analyzer); Open the software and run "tools->align" (before connecting RF input to the spectrum analyzer)  

4. Once the RFSoC board is connected to the machine, open a web browser and browse to http://192.168.3.1/lab -> Jupyter Notebook login screen will open 

5. Enter password -> xilinx 

6. Run notebook in the folder lfsr256_512MHz_4gsps 

7. Set mixer frequency to 600MHz (max: 2048MHz) and you should see the nice 512 MHz broadband spectrum on the lab machine.
